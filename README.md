### Overview

**Mood-Based Music Recommendation Web App**

- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Story:** My project aims to build a web application that can recommend different music to its user based on the user's current mood and location data obtained from their Apple Watch. The app will provide an ideal audio experience tailored to the user's emotional state and physical environment.
- **Market:** The app is aimed at tech-savvy music enthusiasts, particularly youths, adults, and professionals who use wearables and are looking for a seamless and personalized music experience. This can also be applicable to anyone who likes music.
- **Habit:** The users are likely to use the app daily, especially during commutes, workouts, leisure time, and even during studying to get music recommendations that match their current mood and activity.
- **Scope:** The initial scope of my idea was mood-based music recommendations, integration with Apple Watch for heart rate and location data, and the user’s Spotify for playlist creation. Out of my scope for now will be adding advanced features like user-generated content or detailed analysis of music preferences.

### Product Spec

- User account creation and login
- Apple Watch integration for heart rate and location data
- Spotify integration for music playback
